The next stage of aiRight’s development is fully embracing the generative AI revolution and leveraging Oraichain’s core technology to improve the space overall. The historic rise of generative AI in 2023 has endowed millions of users around the globe with advanced tools to create stunning images, video, and music in seconds. This innovation has reduced both the time and cost of creativity, empowering individuals to simply express their imagination through prompts. As this promising frontier evolves, the aiRight team is focused on alleviating pain points that threaten wide adoption.

First, while the sheer number of generative AI models available is impressive, each of these products contributes to audience fragmentation, oftentimes forcing users to make a financial commitment which may limit their ability to test and explore alternatives. Users must choose between DALL-E 2, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion and countless competitors, but the task of navigating through all these models, each with its unique interface and access method, can be daunting. The need to hop from one system to another is a real challenge for content creators. By aggregating premium models from every corner of the AI world, aiRight plans to become the preferred one-stop-shop for generative AI creators.

Secondly, in the coming years, we will see significant improvements in the quality and commercial viability of AI-generated content (AIGC). AI images and videos will be a lot sharper, more vivid, and realistic. AI music will be richer and more complex. AI 3D models, like architectural rendering, will be more detailed and production-ready. As lawmakers around the world continue to debate the legality and copyright of AI creations, these advancements will accentuate the need for a clear creatorship structure. aiRight will leverage its patented system for on-chain copyright to provide a streamlined monetization platform, enabling AIGC creators to capitalize on their work.

We’re carefully remodeling aiRight to directly address these challenges and simplify the AI-driven creative process. Our vision is to become a focal point in the AIGC ecosystem, fostering a community of global Generative AI enthusiasts and creative professionals, while establishing ourselves as a reliable resource for the news regarding ongoing development of regulations regarding AI copyrights. aiRight’s unique technology will prove immensely valuable for AIGC creators, providing blockchain-based immutable records of content generation and transaction.

Introducing the new aiRight
===========================

AI-Generated Masterpieces: Serendipitous Discovery & On-chain Preservation
==========================================================================

aiRight gives creators all the tools they need for their AI-driven creative work. However, with Generative AI, the same prompt, no matter how meticulous, even when applied on the same AI model, may still generate different outputs if run at different points in time. We understand that producing the perfect AI-generated work does not happen often, as it needs luck in addition to skills. aiRight, thanks to its blockchain infrastructure, stands ready to capture and secure that rare moment of genius.

In terms of feature design, aiRight is as much an online marketplace, where AI content creators can effectively create, manage, and monetize their works, as a community of Generative AI enthusiasts and creative workers. aiRight is free to use by community members who can freely create, share, download, and discuss AI-generated content. Premium content from top creators and monetization options are available through our monthly subscription tier.

The #1 Platform to Generate AI Contents
=======================================

One platform, access to all the latest Generative AI models, including premium ones such as Midjourney. The list is growing day by day. Models vary in output type, input format, and use cases. Future developments also include editing tools, along with prompt evaluation & suggestion features.

aiRight ensures a seamless user experience, allowing fast Web3 login and rapid content generation, price setting, and minting within seconds.

On-chain Copyright
==================

aiRight possesses a patented technology to detect on-chain infringement & ensure an immutable proof of origin & ownership for every creation on the platform.

With AI, the definition of creatorship is complicated due to the number of parties involved in the generation process. To solve this, aiRight redefines creatorship into authorship and ownership, thereby recognizing the collective contributions that bring each AI-generated work into existence.

*   Authorship: AI authors are the AI developers, the owners of the data that are used to train the AI, and the AI model itself, thus ensuring that the foundation upon which the generative work is built is acknowledged and properly credited.
*   Ownership: AI owners are the individuals who use the AI model through inputs, instructions, and prompts. They ultimately control how and when the AI is utilized and the kind of outputs it generates.

Each time an AI-generated multimedia is made on Oraichain, a copyright is created, recognizing both the original owner and authors. Changes in copyright are also recorded on-chain with each transaction. In addition, with aiRight’s AI Similarity Scanning, on-chain infringements can be detected at different levels: Exact duplicate, Near-exact duplicate, Edited copy, and Semantic closeness.

Gallery & Marketplace
=====================

aiRight provides a one-stop destination for creators to showcase and transact AI-generated works, including both prompts and outputs. Monetization options include selling prompts, selling content outright, selling the right to download & use content, and potential revenue sharing with aiRight.
