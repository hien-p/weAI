_In 2023, OraiDEX has grown beyond a simple AMM and added a range of CeDeFi products, including Order Book and Futures, further bolstering its offerings. In addition, the recent reveal of the AI Trader feature gives OraiDEX users a glimpse into the future of the platform. As the platform begins to solidify it’s identity, the proposed ORAIX/USDC pool is the first of many steps to strengthen OraiDEX’s independence._

We are excited to share our proposal to create the ORAIX/USDC pool on OraiDEX, providing deep initial liquidity for the pair and attractive incentives for future liquidity providers. Following the release of OraiDEX V3, this pool is the first in a series of actions that will strengthen ORAIX and establish it as an important asset within OraiDEX product. We are grateful for all community members who have supported OraiDEX to this point, participating in testing, governance and providing a steady stream of feedback for our team to improve product. We are confident that OraiDEX will continue to be a major element of Oraichain’s growth in the coming years.

Proposal #202
=============

Create a new pool on OraiDEX for ORAIX/USDC pair with initial incentives starting at 100% APY in ORAIX.

**Pool Details**

*   ORAIX/USDC pool on OraiDEX with $400K in liquidity from the Foundation (50% ORAIX + 50% USDC)
*   Initial incentives starting at 100% APY in ORAIX\*\* for liquidity providers. Please note: APR dynamically changes based on the total liquidity in ORAIX/USDC Pool.
*   Support for native USDC via Noble, allowing for frictionless transfers between IBC chains.

\*\*Note, there is a typo in the on-chain proposal here. Under the pool details section, rewards should be in ORAIX only.

Why USDC?
=========

The introduction of IBC-native USDC via Noble is a major milestone for the Cosmos ecosystem and can help to improve user experience for users on Oraichain. And while Oraichain has leaned heavily on USDT in the past, the growing popularity and continued confidence in USDC plays a major role in our decision. In addition, we are happy to support native USDC via Noble and will support seamless transfers to IBC-enabled chains. We consider USDC a trustworthy and reliable option thanks to its market dominance, transparency, and being fiat-backed at a more safely audited rate compared to others ([https://www.circle.com/en/transparency](https://www.circle.com/en/transparency)).

Why now?
========

We are constantly listening to feedback from the Oraichain and OraiDEX communities. Your input helps to drive our development, creating a symbiotic relationship between the team and users. The recent discussions surrounding ORAIX utility and ORAI rewards on OraiDEX over the past several weeks prompted swift preparation of actions to satisfy the needs of the community. The current governance proposals #200 and #201 have further highlighted the specific desires of our DAO. In response, we are happy to begin enacting our plans to strengthen ORAIX.

Governance is Awesome
=====================

We love our community. In many ways, governance is the main point of Web3, allowing any community member to make their voice heard and have their vote counted. We are grateful to all those who have added to the conversation, taken the initiative to make proposals on-chain and passionately support the health of the Oraichain ecosystem. Keep going!
