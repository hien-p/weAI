**_yAI.Finance’s Portfolio_**  **_tracker_** _now adds a_ **_My NFTs_** _tab that lists your NFTs assets. yAI.Finance is currently supporting NFTs from Kawaii Islands and will expand to more platforms in the near future. For any NFT projects, we welcome all to join us by filling out this_ [**_form_**](https://forms.gle/xdYZgDnRTFDD8DLDA)_._

We are ready to support investors in tracking their ‘non-fungible token’ assets, commonly known as NFTs, along with other investments in one place — **_yAI.Finance’s Portfolio_**. For the time being, all NFT-based collectibles from the game **_‘Kawaii Islands’_** can be found here easily.

In spite of being recognized on blockchain networks and considered valuable assets, popular non-custodial wallets like Metamask and TrustWallet show only a bit of information about NFTs that a user stores inside his wallet. Blockchain explorers (Etherscan, BscScan) provide necessary details but do not retrieve the content, requiring a few extra steps if one needs to observe his NFTs.

yAI.Finance now helps us keep the visuality close at hand: Under the **_DeFi Analytics_** menu, the **_Portfolio_** section adds a **_My NFTs_** tab that showcases image content of NFTs. In the case of **_‘Kawaii Islands’_**, these NFTs can be Fields, Plants, Creatures, Materials, Dyes, or Decors, which are essential tokenized pieces for players to equip with while immersing in the fantasy world of Kawaii Islands.

yAI.Finance will expand this NFT management feature across more platforms to create greater convenience for investors, especially NFT collectors and gamers. For any projects that work on NFT generation/issuance and want to list those assets to yAI.Finance’s Portfolio tracker,  **_we welcome all to join us by filling out this_** [**_form_**](https://forms.gle/xdYZgDnRTFDD8DLDA)**_._**

Let’s watch out for every update from yAI.Finance!
