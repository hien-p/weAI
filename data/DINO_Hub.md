**_“Data Intelligence and Oracle”_** _— DINO Hub will play an important part in the Oraichain AI ecosystem as being the center for Data and AI. DINO Hub will expand the lifecycle of both Data and AI beyond the current existing markets to Blockchain via Oracles and AI Oracles. Let’s explore this transformation of Oraichain Data Hub._

Getting to know DINO Hub
========================

DINO, which stands for **Data Intelligence and Oracle**, is a Web3-inspired platform that aims to innovate trust and decentralization through expanding the lifecycle of Data & AI to Blockchain. DINO Hub is structured with one main center, called DINO center, and two satellite ports namely Data Marketplace and AI Marketplace.

*   **DINO Center:** Dedicated to providing crowd-sourcing tools for creating datasets and analytics tools for analyzing data or training Machine learning or AI models. DINO center can be thought of as a center for creators and builders, who join Web3 to create data, test cases, or intelligent solutions (AI models).
*   **Data Marketplace**: Dedicated to many data-related businesses such as selling, buying, requesting, and staking. Unlike conventional data marketplaces, DINO Data Marketplace will focus on a special kind of data: test case data. Test cases are to validate AI models in a decentralized fashion: their robustness, accuracy, and generalizability. Only those who pass the test can be considered “trustful” to be used in decentralized applications. We estimate a great demand for this type of data in the near future.
*   **AI Marketplace**: Dedicated to the exchanging of AI services. DINO AI Marketplace is a one-stop shop for AI solutions that have versatile integration power: embedding directly into one’s business, integrating to smart contracts, or AI Oracles. There are also purpose-specific AI service categories for “defending” or “automation”. We’ll introduce these in another article.

The life cycle of Data and AI in DINO Hub
=========================================

The following diagram briefly describes how DINO ports interconnect with each other. The various paths demonstrate the Lifecycle of Data and AI in many expanded paths in the lifecycle of Data and AI, interwound in the Blockchain sphere.

DINO Hub? Why does Oraichain Data Hub need a rebrand?
=====================================================

The rebranding is due to both technical and pragmatic viewpoints. From the technical point of view, the DINO center and the other two Marketplace ports have different technical bases to build upon: labeling tools and analytics tools require higher-level backend specifications while marketplaces emphasize user experience.

From a pragmatic viewpoint, DINO Hub has many innovative concepts and functions, which require users to gradually get acquainted with them. The division will provide more friendly interfaces for users and easier to navigate through such features of DINO Hub.

Typical use cases of DINO Hub
=============================

Here are some examples of how you can take advantage of DINO Hub to earn while contributing to the global ecosystem of Web3.

*   **_Earn in sparse time:_** Join DINO Hub in your sparse time as an annotator to earn by building datasets, labeling data, or creating test cases.
*   **_Streamline Data or AI to earn:_** You can earn by providing your data or AI services on Marketplaces.
