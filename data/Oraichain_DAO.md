_As more Oraichain community members delegate and participate in DAO activities, it is increasingly important to understand the distinct differences between proposal types on Oraiscan. This article will give you a brief overview of each type of proposal, how they are used, and when to alert fellow DAO members when the wrong type of proposal is used._

Today, we’re going to have a closer look at Oraichain’s governance process, highlighting some important details that all proposers should be aware of before submitting a proposal for voting on-chain. Over the past several months, Oraichain has welcomed many new DAO members and we’ve seen a steady uptick in community led governance actions. The Oraichain Foundation is very proud to see individuals rise to the occasion, helping to fulfill the vision of a truly decentralized Oraichain ecosystem, but it is important to understand the process from end-to-end.

In our discussion, key platforms to participate in governance actions, we will have a look at the overall best practices for proposers and, most importantly, the different proposal types available on Oraiscan (and when to use them!).

Governance Platforms
====================

The Oraichain community is spread across many different social channels, such as Telegram, Discord, X (formerly Twitter), Reddit and more. In order to streamline the governance process, the Oraichain Foundation provides two important tools to make discussion, proposals and voting transparent for all community members.

[**Commonwealth**](https://commonwealth.im/oraichain)

*   Commonwealth is dApp used by many Web3 communities to facilitate all stages of the governance process. Users can sign in with email, OWallet or Keplr to create an account and begin participating in discussions. Oraichain’s Commonwealth forum is the starting place for all new proposals, allowing users to create a new thread and engage with all stakeholders before moving to on-chain voting.

[**Oraiscan**](https://scan.orai.io)

*   Oraiscan is Oraichain’s explorer, serving as the primary user interface for everything that happens on-chain. In relation to governance, Oraiscan allows user to delegate voting power to validators in the active set, create proposals, track proposal status and vote on proposals.

Best Practices
==============

Now that you’re familiar with the governance platforms, we’re ready to begin the process of forming a proposal. Below is a short list of best practices

**Have a clear objective.**

*   Every governance proposal should have a clear goal. Proposers should highlight the importance of each initiative and why it is important to take up a proposal now.

**Have a plan for execution.**

*   Every proposal should have a clear description of deliverables and ensure that all relevant parties are included in the planning period. Having a clear timeline for execution is key to building trust from the broader community.

**Know the risks.**

*   Every proposal has its risks and it is very important to be honest about this. We recommend giving a brief overview of potential risk factors and any planned controls to mitigate.

**Engage the community in discussion.**

*   As we all work together to promote an inclusive governance process, we recommend a minimum of 7 day discussion period before moving to on-chain voting. This discussion period should take place on Commonwealth to maximize visibility for all community members. During this time, proposers and DAO members should collaborate on engaging the community to participate in discussion and contribute their insights. Ultimately, this period should result in a revised and improved proposal.

**Poll the community throughout the discussion period.**

*   Polling can be a great way for the DAO members to gauge whether a proposal has sufficient support to justify submitting on-chain. While it may be difficult to predict the final, this unofficial vote can help draw attention to unresolved issues and give the community and opportunity to come to consensus before official voting begins.

Proposal Types
==============

You’re finally ready to submit your proposal on-chain for voting! Congratulations, but the work isn’t over yet. Before beginning the deposit period, it is crucial that you make sure to select the correct Proposal Type. While every proposal type includes a text field for description, there are some specific differences that every member should be familiar with. Choosing the improper proposal type could potentially result in rejection or veto, so it is very important to pay special attention here.

**Text Proposal**

*   This proposal type allows the DAO to formally adopt policy, initiatives or actions without automatically triggering an on-chain event. For most situations, Text Proposals will be the most appropriate option — especially in instances related to product changes. Even in the case on DAO Treasury Spending, a Text Proposal can be a good step to formally approve spending before distributing funds.

**DAO Treasury Spend**

*   This proposal type allows the DAO to immediately send tokens from the treasury to a predetermined address on-chain. DAO Treasury Spend proposals can be used to immediately fund initiatives or to appropriate funds to sub-DAOs for committee management.

**Unbonding Time**

*   This change proposal will immediately adjust unbonding time for delegators on Oraichain mainnet. This parameter is measured in nano seconds. Unbonding time is currently set to approximately 14 days and shouldn’t be adjusted without ample discussion from the DAO.

**Voting Period**

*   This change proposal will immediately adjust the voting period for new governance proposals. This parameter is measured by either days or hours. Voting period is currently set to approximately 5 days.

**Community Tax**

*   This proposal type is used to add a tax to transaction fees. Proceeds from this tax are automatically deposited the the DAO Treasury.

**Minimum + Maximum Inflation**

*   These parameter changes directly effect emissions on Oraichain mainnet, controlling the rate at which new tokens are minted. This proposal type should only be used after thorough discussion and full evaluation of impact.

**Minimum Deposit Amount**

*   This parameter change will adjust the deposit required for proposals to enter the voting period on Oraichain mainnet. The current deposit is 10 ORAI. This should only be changed after thorough discussion and evaluation of impact. Please note: proposers are not obligated to contribute the full balance for deposits themselves, but have the option to solicit deposit contributions from other DAO members. Deposits are returned after voting period has ended, except in the instance Oraichain DAO votes “no with veto”; this will result in the deposit tokens to be burned.

**Update Admin**

*   This proposal type is used to update the admin for a smart contract on Oraichain mainnet. It shouldn’t be used without a clear purpose and full discussion amongst all relevant parties.

**Software Upgrade Proposal**

*   This proposal type is used to upgrade software for Oraichain mainnet to the newest version. This proposal type is not currently available for the public. All software updates are currently managed by the Oraichain Foundation.

Conclusion
==========

To highlight the importance of today’s discussion, we’d like to draw attention to [Proposal #199](https://scan.orai.io/proposals/199). In this instance, the community member made an error in proposal type selection: the user should have chosen a text proposal, but instead chose a parameter change proposal. As a result, DAO members and validators were forced to vote no, regardless of the proposals intended purpose.

We hope this overview has been helpful for all DAO members. We will continue to support community-led initiative and look forward to building the future of Oraichain together. If you have any questions or need assistance in any part of the governance process, please reach out to one of our community managers! We are always here to help.
