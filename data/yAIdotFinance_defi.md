_“DeFi overview dashboard” brings yAI.Finance users an overview of key components of the DeFi ecosystem across many chains. With intuitive charts for diverse data sources of many DeFi platforms and exchanges, this new feature will greatly assist investors in understanding the health of the DeFi ecosystem as well as in making investments._

[_Check it now!_](https://yai.finance/overview)

Decentralized Finance (DeFi), an open and fast growing global financial system, has been underpinned by the advancement of blockchain technologies, digital assets, and finance services. In its vision of becoming an **_“AI-powered Yield Aggregator Platform”_**, **yAI.Finance** will gradually implement and introduce new features.

In this tech update, the **DeFi Overview Dashboard** is added. This dashboard provides **_an overview of key components of the DeFi ecosystem_**: decentralized exchanges (DEXes), gas price, lending platforms, DeFi tokens, stablecoins, among others. The DeFi data is collected from diverse sources and represented in intuitive charts for your convenience.

There are many charts in **DeFi Overview Dashboard**, which are organized within the following sections:

**Global**

Where you can find general information of the DeFi markets such as its dominance, volume, and tokens.

**Gas analytics**

There are charts for gas prices at different times in the last seven days and gas costs for various tasks on the ETH network. You can work out good times to make your transactions based on the information.

**DEXes**

DEXes are obviously the major part of the DeFi infrastructure. We show the volume and number of active users for major DEXes.

**Lending**

In addition to the current lending interest rates, here you can find summary data of three major lending platforms: Aave, Compound, and MakerDAO.

**Stablecoins**

Stablecoins, price-stable cryptocurrencies, have become a backbone for payments and DeFi services. This part contains charts showing historical data of circulation and volume of major stablecoins.

In the future, more DeFi data for aggregators, synthetic assets, insurance, apps, and DeFi 2.0 will be added. We would love to hear your feedback on the dashboard. Please let us know if you want to include your favorite metrics.
